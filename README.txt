Hobnob is a CoAP Protocol Simulator. The goal of Hobnob is to 
create a web based server through which one could send different packets
and packet streams, listen for responses (if confirmable), modify packet
formats to check for compliance etc.. It's primarily a testing tool
that can be used to debug, and verify how a server behaves.
